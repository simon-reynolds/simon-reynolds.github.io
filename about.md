My name is Simon Reynolds and I am a software developer who specialises in .NET web applications.
I have been programming professionally for over 4 years and tinkering with code for over twice that. I blog, I write code, primarily in C# although I am currently learning more about Node.js and F#.

I am a husband and a father, living with my family in Dublin, Ireland.
