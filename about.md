My name is Simon Taite and I am a software developer who specialises in .NET web applications.
I have been programming since my teens, profesionally since my 20s. I blog, I write code, primarily in C# for work but mostly F# at home.

I am a husband and a father, living with my family in Dublin, Ireland.
